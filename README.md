# 🎙️ Lip-Synced AI Character Generation using Diffusion Models (Arabic Dataset)

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on generating **realistic, lip-synced AI characters** capable of speaking **Arabic**, using **diffusion models**. The aim is to provide a cost-effective, culturally relevant solution for creating educational videos and course explanations in Arabic.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Extend the **LatentSync** framework to support Arabic speech.  
- Train a **diffusion-based model** for generating talking characters with accurate lip synchronization.  
- Automate the generation of animated educational content in Arabic.

## 🧠 Key Features  
- 🗣️ **Arabic Lip Sync Support**: Trained on custom Arabic speech data scraped and processed from the web.  
- 🧬 **Diffusion-Based Generation**: High-quality facial animation driven by advanced generative models.  
- 🎓 **Education-Oriented Output**: Designed to help automate explainer videos for online courses.  
- 🔊 **Custom Audio Alignment**: Integrated preprocessing pipeline for clean audio-visual training data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- 🧪 **LatentSync** for audio-to-lip mapping  
- 🌫️ **Diffusion Models** for facial generation  
- 🐍 **Python**, **PyTorch** for model implementation  
- 🖼️ **OpenCV**, **FFmpeg** for video preprocessing  
- 🔎 **Web Scraping** (YTLP-D library) for Arabic dataset creation

## 🗃️ Dataset Details  
- Collected Arabic speech and facial video data from online educational sources.  
- Processed to align phonemes with facial landmarks for training.  
- Dataset includes:
  - Cleaned audio files  
  - Extracted video frames  
  - Landmark/phoneme alignment labels
